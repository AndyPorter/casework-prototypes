          <p class="lede">this is where we wildly iterate casework ideas</p>

          <p>Prototypes of ideas live here, and notes to explain how they fared at user testing.</p>

          <p>So this app then contains a history of iterations - what we learnt from users.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Protos</h2>
        <h3>Proto 1</h3>
        <p>Aim: (hypothesis to test / what we want to learn)</p>
        <p>Can we run this?  - visualise and explain the service - what could be the first internal beta - to process digital mortgage application.</p>
        <p>cover all the functionality required of the service.  what happens in the new system/processes, what happens in exisiting systems/processes.  What does this thing look like :) ?</p>
        <p><a href="cases">Case list</a></p> 
        <ul>Service Design Assumptions/Parameters  
        <li>We are getting mortgage applications from a few, known, lenders</li>
        <li>Number of applications will be small.</li>
        <li>Internal processing team will be small, co-located, and co-located with the service development team - operate, iterate and support the application/service as one team.</li>
        <li>we will be iterating/bug fixing/enhancing on a daily basis</li>
        <li>If the new system/process cannot cope with an application we can run it through the existing systems/processes</li>
        <li>first release could look / operate nothing like later releases.</li>
        <li>first release is to learn what we can take away - what isn't technical work/legal judgement - to be able to remove that and leave technical skilled work for staff.</li>
        <li></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Design Principles / User needs/desires
        <li>minimal interaction with existing applications and processes</li>  
        <li>Everything needed to operate the application is brought to the user</li>
        <li>Users are legal technicians</li>
        <li>tools focused on the goal - processinf mortgage appication (not a swiss army knife system)</li>
        <li>simplify language.  clarity and accuracy of terminololgy</li>
        <li>less is best - strip away everything not needed.  start with too little and add.</li>
        <li></li>
        </ul>
